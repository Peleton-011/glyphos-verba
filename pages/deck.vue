      Not quite tarot, not merely oracle. A constellation of symbols drawn from ancient
      whispers and timeless truths.

      <p>
        This is a deck of
        <span class="italic">echoes and essences</span>. A mirror of myth, muse, and
        memory. Each card holds a
        <span class="font-medium">poetic essence</span>
        — a distilled presence, a breath between words.
      </p>

      <p>
        These are not strict archetypes, but
        <span class="italic">living metaphors</span>. Some come veiled in song, others
        cloaked in silence. Some bear divine names, others arrive unnamed but deeply
        familiar.
      </p>

        <p>There is music here: invisible rhythms, cosmic wheels, sacred proportions.</p>
        <p>There is memory here: of gods, of muses, of faded empires and future myths.</p>
        <p>
          There is meaning here: not rigid, but resonant — waiting to be drawn, heard, and
          held.
        </p>

      <p>
        <span class="font-semibold">Upright</span> cards reveal alignment, clarity, or
        invitation. <br />
        <span class="font-semibold">Reversed</span> cards suggest friction, distortion, or
        concealed truths. <br />
        But neither is “good” nor “bad” — each is a note in the whole.
      </p>

      <p>
        This deck is meant to be read
        <span class="italic">intuitively, reflectively</span>, with the ear turned toward
        the unseen melody of things. Use it as a guide, a poetic mirror, or a companion in
        your own unfolding.
