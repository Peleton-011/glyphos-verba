# glyphos-verba
This project implements a system for generating ambient poetry. It utilizes wordbanks, mutation functions, card-based influences, and user queries to produce flowing, multi-sentence responses. Built with modularity in mind, it's designed to be easily expanded with new templates, words, and cards.
